# JavaScript30

This is my work as I attempt Web Bos's 30 day challenge, JavaScript30!

I intend to/will be attempting each preject without video guidance first.

Note: All this code is my version of Wes Bos's course projects and built with his starter code
and help along the way. 

Please go check out this course that is totally free and a great learning resource.
